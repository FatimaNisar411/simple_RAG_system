Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful AI systems built using transformer architectures, trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human-like language. Their development began with GPT-1 and evolved through GPT-2 and GPT-3, which introduced few-shot and zero-shot capabilities. GPT-4 and GPT-4o further enhanced performance and introduced multimodal understanding, handling both text and non-text inputs. LLMs are widely used in real-world applications like chatbots, summarization, question answering, translation, content generation, and code completion. Their ability to generalize across tasks with minimal fine-tuning makes them an essential tool in modern AI systems.

Before feeding data into an LLM, the raw text must go through preprocessing and tokenization. Preprocessing involves cleaning the data by removing special characters, lowercasing, and eliminating noise. Tokenization breaks down text into smaller units called tokens. Techniques include word-level tokenization, subword-level tokenization (which improves handling of rare words), Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), and SentencePiece, which treats input as a stream of characters. These steps ensure the model understands the structure of language in a consistent, meaningful way.

Training LLMs requires collecting high-quality data, defining a training objective (typically next-token prediction using cross-entropy loss), and using powerful hardware like GPUs or TPUs. Modern training methods involve transfer learning, where a model is first pretrained on a large general corpus and then fine-tuned on a specific task. Hugging Face Transformers is a popular framework for this, providing tools to easily load models, prepare datasets, and run training loops. Fine-tuning helps adapt general models to specialized domains such as legal text, medical records, or customer service chats.

Embeddings are dense vector representations of text that preserve semantic meaning. Word embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe assign static vectors to words, while contextual embeddings from models like BERT and GPT vary based on context. These embeddings are used for semantic search and are stored in vector databases like ChromaDB, Pinecone, or FAISS. Vector databases allow efficient similarity searches by comparing query embeddings with stored document embeddings. This capability is essential for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where relevant documents are fetched and used to provide more accurate, context-rich answers.
